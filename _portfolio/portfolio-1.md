title: "Upper Limits on Stellar Companions in  Kepler Circumbinary Systems"
excerpt: "Circumbinary systems are systems with planets that orbit around both stars of a stellar system. We obtained new spectra of Kepler-34 and Kepler-35, two circumbinary systems, nearly a decade after these systems were originally detected, to search for RV trends from a potential third stellar-mass companion at long periods.<br/><img src='/images/Kepler_34_Spectra.png' style='width:50%;>"
