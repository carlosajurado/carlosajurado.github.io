title: "The Effects of Natal Kicks in The Galactic Center"
excerpt: " Natal kicks are the velocity kicks that neutron stars, and possibly black holes, receive at birth. These kicks, which can reach speeds of hundreds of kilometers per second, can drastically alter the orbital configuration of the stellar remnant from its initial configuration. In this work, we model the effects of natal kicks on a Galactic Center (GC)
population of massive stars and stellar binaries with different initial density distributions."
